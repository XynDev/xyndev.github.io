# Functions

Functions are fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. They allow you to encapsulate code for reuse, improve readability, and organize your program's logic into manageable pieces.

## What Is a Function?

A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions can take inputs (parameters), execute code, and return an output. They help you avoid repetition by allowing you to write code once and reuse it wherever needed.

::: tip Quick Tip
When naming functions, use verbs that describe the action performed (e.g., `calculateSum`, `displayMessage`).
:::

## Declaring Functions

There are several ways to define functions in JavaScript:

### Function Declarations

This is the most common way to define a function. A function declaration begins with the `function` keyword followed by a name, a list of parameters in parentheses, and a block of code.

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### Function Expressions

Functions can also be defined as expressions. In this case, the function is stored in a variable.

```javascript
const greet = function(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};
```

### Arrow Functions

Introduced in ES6, arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing functions. They are especially useful for simple, one-line functions.

```javascript
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

::: note Important
Arrow functions do not have their own `this` binding, which makes them unsuitable for all situations. Use them when you need a concise syntax without a custom `this` context.

## Parameters and Return Values

### Parameters

Parameters act as placeholders for the values that you pass to a function. They allow functions to operate on different data without rewriting code.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Return Values

Functions can return a value using the `return` statement. If no value is returned, the function returns `undefined` by default.

```javascript
const result = add(5, 3); // result is 8
```

## Function Scope

The scope of a function determines the accessibility of variables defined within it. Variables declared inside a function are not accessible outside of it, which helps prevent unintended interactions.

```javascript
function example() {
  let localVar = "I'm local";
  console.log(localVar);
}
example();
// console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
```

::: info How It Works
Function scope creates a private space for your code, ensuring that variables do not conflict with those in other parts of your program.
:::

## Best Practices for Functions

- **Keep functions small and focused:** Each function should perform a single task.
- **Use descriptive names:** Function names should clearly indicate what the function does.
- **Avoid side effects:** Functions should minimize changes to variables outside their own scope.
- **Document your functions:** Include comments or documentation to explain what your function does, its parameters, and its return value.

## Conclusion

Functions are a powerful tool in JavaScript that allow you to write reusable, organized, and efficient code. By understanding how to declare, use, and manage functions, you lay the groundwork for building complex and scalable applications.
